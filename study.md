## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
  -Do you mean like what kind of arrays and stuff? Max said going over the boggle game might help, so I'll start with a similar structuring except 3x3 instead of 4x4.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  -I'm not sure what this is asking, but I think at the bare minimum I'll start out with something similar to our card game, nine cards that flip over when clicked/ flip over automatically with the opposite "team" after my click.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
  -I'd like to follow the recommended schedule, and if I haven't gotten enough done by Wednesday I want to schedule a 1 on 1... I definitely want to study the logic from fundamentals 10.2 in the beginning. I think I'm probably going to focus on prettying the visuals last, to be honest, since I'm more concerned with making everything work... but otherwise I'll most likely stick to the schedule.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  -As a user, I can create a new account with a password to save my wins/losses/draws record
  -As a user, I can log in to add to my record.
  -As a user, I can change my password if I get tired of it.
  -As a user, I can play tic tac toe.
  -As a user, I can log out.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  -I'll do my best to be organized with my files, adding folders if necessary and clearly labeling all my variables.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  -I mean, some graphics drawing the x's and o's would be cool... will probably play around with CSS to make the design creative and pretty.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  -Tons and tons of git commits, most likely.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - If I'm done with all the requirements by the time I go to bed Saturday night, then yes.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
